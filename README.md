# Skateparks In Data

## Introduction
Welcome to our project Skateparks in Data! <br>
This is a data analytics project showing data vizualisations for skateparks in the city of Malmö, Sweden.

We have collected our own data through [this form](https://forms.gle/bnrpm9Uh3p7dtmtU9) regarding skateparks in the city Malmö (Sweden).


## Motivation
We wanted to see how many people that ride either: Skateboard, kickbike, BMX or inlines/roller blades at different skateparks at different times during the day, how the age-groups differ and so on in Malmö. <br><br>
Since the city of Malmö is investing in skateboarding and considered a popular skateboarding-town, we hope that our project will be of interest.<br><br>
We also hope that our project can help you in your project.
